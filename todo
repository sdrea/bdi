For IPC, please report percentage of improvement relative to the baseline scheme. This makes it easier to compare the compressed cache and the 
baseline cache.

To justify your plan for thesis, you need to report performance when delay of compression is not zero. Please add a new parameter to .cfg, let's 
call it -delay_compressed_cache. This delay is added to the delay of the baseline cache only if a read block is compressed. You should take into 
account delay ONLY for read not for write as a write operation is not on the critical path and can be done in parallel with other tasks.

The last item is comparison of the compressed cache with a cache which its size is double the size of the baseline scheme (both data and tag). This 
cache is uncompressed. We should show that IPC of the compressed cache is similar to the double sized cache but its power is less. If you have time, 
you can run simulation for this one before seminar; if not, you can leave it for thesis.
